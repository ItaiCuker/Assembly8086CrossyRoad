# Assembly8086CrossyRoad
10th Grade Assembly x8086 game final project. 

# How to run
## Windows
Download [DOSBOX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/files/latest/download), upload files to BIN folder, if compiler files already exists replace them.

## Running the pacman.asm
```sh
$ tasm cmain.asm
$ tlink cmain
$ cmain
```
##if DOSBOX proccesing is on the slow side
compiling takes a lot of time/ game running slow
than hit this command inside the bash:
```sh
$ cycles = max
```

# Where and how to finish?

I won't explain the entire project for my convenience. but here are explanations for my saving score procs:

-Cdata stores all the variables (Documentation in Hebrew sorry...)
-Cscore has all the score procedures including the ones for the file writing and reading.

I don't know how close It is to working, I didn't touch this project for almost a year now. 

gl and Enjoy!
