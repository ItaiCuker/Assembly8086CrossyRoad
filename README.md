I won't explain the entire project for my convenience. but here are explanations for my saving score procs:

-Cdata stores all the variables (Documentation in Hebrew sorry...)
-Cscore has all the score procedures including the ones for the file writing and reading.

I don't know how close It is to working, I didn't touch this project for almost a year now. 

gl and Enjoy!
